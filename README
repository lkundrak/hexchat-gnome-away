GNOME ScreenSaver auto-away Hexchat plugin
==========================================

This is a simple Hexchat plugin, that marks you away while your GNOME desktop 
screensaver is active.

Installation
------------

  $ pkcon install gcc make hexchat-devel glib2-devel
  $ make
  $ su
  # make install

Alternatively, you can install unprivileged into your home directory:

  $ pkcon install gcc make hexchat-devel glib2-devel
  $ make
  $ make local-install

Contributing
------------

The plugin is very simple and provides no means of configuration.
Feel free to send me patches.
